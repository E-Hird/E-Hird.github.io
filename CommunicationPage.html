            Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            The development of communication networks on computers has allowed for information to be more freely shared.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some ways that computing and the internet has improved the spread of information:  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Search engines
            </li>
            <p>
                Search engines allow for users to find information that they are looking for without needing to know the website or source where it is found.
                Search engines work by looking at the website traffic of other users and trying to find websites which other people with similar searches want to access.
                Machine learning algorithms are used to increase the effectivity of search engines.
                Search engines need to understand the search phrase by understanding the context which words are used in as well as understanding and correcting mistakes.
                More recently full AI tools are used as a major way to search for information due to their more complex algorithms and greater reliance on machine learning leading to them having a better natural language processing and more direct output.
            </p>
            <li>
                Access to Academic Research
            </li>
            <p>
                The internet has given more people access to academic journals and research due to the fact that information is uploaded to the internet for the purposes of collaboration and sharing information.
                This also allows academic research to be found more easily without having to go to a library and get books.
                Academic developments can also be reported by other sites online with links to show where information is collected from. 
            </p>
            <li>
                Referencing and sources
            </li>
            <p>
                Despite the fact that false information can be easily spread over the internet, the internet makes it easier than ever to check other sources about a particular topic or check articles that the information your reading links to.
                Each page can directly link to any references.
            </p>

        <p>
            Social media is now widely used with platforms now having billions of users to communicate both with people already known and is used to reach an audience.

            Here is a table of the top 5 social media platforms and their users:

            Communication using computers has allowed for people across the world to find each other as well as stay in touch.
            This has had a large positive effect on the world and allowed people from different countries and backgrounds to connect to each other and work together on common goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Translation technology has greatly aided worldwide communciation and has facilitated conversation between people and groups who do not speak the same language.
            Translation software commonly uses machine learning technology by taking a large amount of text from two languages which means the same thing and then processing it using AI to find links between how the sentences are structured.
            The use of machine learning makes the translation software more than a dictionary because it is able to take a whole sentence and context into account instead of just relying on a one-to-one word translation.
