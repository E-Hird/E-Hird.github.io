							Data Collection
						</span>
						<span>
							The traditional method of collecting data through manual processes is time-consuming and prone to human error. Advanced technologies like sensors, satellites, and wearable devices have made data collection more efficient and accurate. For instance, researchers can use GPS sensors to track animal movements, and satellite imagery to monitor changes in the environment. Similarly, wearable devices like fitness trackers can provide real-time data on human behavior and health, enabling researchers to conduct more accurate and precise studies.

							Data Analysis
						</span>
						<span>
							Computer applications empower analysts with powerful tools, automation capabilities, and computational resources to efficiently and effectively analyze data, uncover insights, and make data-driven decisions. They enhance productivity, accuracy, and the ability to handle large-scale data analysis tasks that would be challenging or impossible to perform manually.
							<br><br>
							With the advent of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence tools, data analysis has become more efficient and accurate. These technologies can analyze large datasets, identify patterns and trends, and provide insights that might otherwise be missed. For example, machine learning algorithms can help researchers analyze complex genetic data and identify genetic mutations that are associated with certain diseases.

					</div> 
					<div class="item-container">
						<span>
							Computer Simulation
						</span>
						<span>
							The use of a computer to represent the dynamic responses of one system by the behaviour of another system modeled after it. A simulation uses a mathematical description, or model, of a real system in the form of a computer program.
							<br><br>
							Computer simulations have made it possible for researchers to test hypotheses and simulate complex phenomena in a virtual environment. This can save time and resources, and improve the accuracy of results. For example, physicists can use computer simulations to study the behavior of subatomic particles, and biologists can use simulations to test the efficacy of drugs.

					<div class="item-container">
						<span>
							Access to Information
						</span>
						<span>
							With the advent of internet, and networks, there had been a centralised of sending information from one individual to another. Written texts can be published easily with such ease of accessibility among other people.
							<br><br>
							The internet has revolutionized the way scientific research is published and communicated. Researchers can publish their work online, making it accessible to a global audience. They can also communicate their findings through social media, blogs, and other online platforms, enabling them to reach a wider audience and engage with the public.
						</span>
					</div>
					<div class="item-container">
						<span>
							Data Visualisation
						</span>
						<span>
							With the creation of software computing tools, researchers are then able to create compelling data visualisations with indifferent automation of these softwares to provide rigorous and accurate representations. Computers had made it possible to process large amounts of data at lightning speed.
						</span>
					</div>
					<div class="item-container">
						<span>
							Assistive Technologies
						</span>
						<span>
							Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can be used to contribute for the development predictive models for analyzing complex data to discover patterns and insights that perhaps may not be apparent through traditional methods.
						</span>
					</div>
					<div class="item-container">
						<span>
							Speed and Efficiency
						</span>
						<span>
							Due to the nature of computers being programmable, researchers can make a program that suits a purpose for their research. Repetitious task, and data calculation can be automated with computers through programming.
						</span>
					</div>
					<div class="item-container">
						<span>
							Collaboration
						</span>
						<span>
							Technology has made it easier for researchers from different parts of the world to collaborate and share data and findings. Online tools like video conferencing, shared workspaces, and cloud-based storage have made collaboration more efficient and effective. This has enabled scientists to work together on large-scale research projects, share expertise, and pool resources.
							<br><br>
							Researchers can use online collaboration tools: video conferencing tools, collaborative writing applications, and wikis. These applications make it easy for researchers to communicate and work on the same thing with ease.
